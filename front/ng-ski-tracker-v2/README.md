# NgSkiTrackerV2

This untouched app is like an untouched endlessly smooth chowdery field of fresh pow. So much stoke and potential that the hype is unbearable and maxin out my sendometers.

In general tho, this angular application will hold all modules for any FE facing application required for the ski tracker. We'll likely use user types to determine which sub moduels to lazy load for the user.

This may or may not contain sub modules for features shared across applications (that's undecided at this point in time). Since this is just an angular app, we may want to separate very general basic features in case we have other FE applications (that aren't angular apps) that could import the dumb basic features for general utilization (if feasable).

But the main goal is to keep this big hoss/bad boy as general, dumb, configurable, and scalable as possible. It's as simple as that...

It's time to strap on those boots and crank those dins up to their absolute max and charge through some pow that's hopefully sittin on a fat base and isn't hiding any snow sharks under that gorgeous fluffy surface.
